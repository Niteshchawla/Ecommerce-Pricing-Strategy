# Ecommerce-Pricing-Strategy
The goal of this EDA is to set a pricing strategy for an ecommerce company that not only brings in the most money but also draws in a good number of customers to purchase your products. Optimizing retail prices is like finding the sweet spot between how much you charge for your products and how many people are willing to buy them at that price. This process includes using data and smart pricing strategies to figure out the perfect balance, ensuring most sales and profits while keeping your customers satisfied.
